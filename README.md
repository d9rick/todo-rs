# Todo-rs: A simple todo app
**todo-rs** is a simple todo app that I wrote to teach myself the Rust programming language.
It currently holds the following features:
- Can add tasks
- Can remove tasks
- Can update tasks
- After closing the application, tasks are saved in a *tasks.txt* file in csv format
- The tasks are read in from *tasks.txt* in the root directory

## Future Functionality:
- UI with terminal in raw mode
- Use arrow keys to move
- Can click tasks away
- Bottom bar to type new tasks in
- Task priorities
